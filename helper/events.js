Questions will be mostly based on basic RC and RL circuits.", "For UG2 and UG3 participants, questions will be mostly from analog circuit design, digital circuit design, circuit theory, signals and system.", "The test will be comprising of multiple choice questions(MCQ) and numerical answer type(NAT) questions. Negative marking will be present. Further details regarding the marking  scheme will be mentioned at the time of exam.", "The top 5 teams from UG1 and the top 10 teams from UG2 & UG3 combined.(Restricted to a maximum of 5 UG3 teams) will be eligible for Round-2", "In ROUND 2: This will be an interactive session for the groups. It will be composed of questions which need your intuition and designing skills to be applied. Each group will be given one question and you need to work it out along with the host.", "No need to worry about the difficulty level. The questions will be adapted accordingly for UG1, UG2 and UG3.", "Do bring your own SCRIBBLE PADS and PEN to do the rough work."],
