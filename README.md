## Features

### User Section
- User can sign in directly using their Google Accounts
- Register in various events as individual or in Team 
- Invite their friends to join their team
- Place order for Merchandise
- Book their seats for Workshop
- Everything can be tracked in Notification Section

### Admin Section
- Built some **Admin Panels** where the specific Event-Coordinators only have the permission to view all the registrations of their corresponding events
- Built a **Merchandise Verification Portal** where Merchandise Admins can verify the orders placed
- Built a **Workshop Admin Portal** where workshop registrations can be easily tracked by some Admins

### Super Admins concept
Actually, the admins have not full access to every pages/portals. The admin-permissions are very limited. Like: The admin of "Pass the Baton" event can view only the "Pass The Baton" Admin Panel not anything more. So, I built some **Super Admins** who can keep an eye upon some of the admins.
